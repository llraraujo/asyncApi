# Developing an Asynchronous ASP.NET Core Web API

Welcome to the course **Developing an Asynchronous ASP.NET Core Web API**! This course is designed to help you improve the scalability of your ASP.NET Core API by making it asynchronous.

## Course Overview

In this course, you will learn how to use the `async` and `await` keywords to write asynchronous code in ASP.NET Core. The course is divided into several key sections:

1. **Understanding Async/Await**:
   - Learn about the internals of `async` and `await`.
   - Understand when and where it makes sense to use asynchronous programming.

2. **Testing Async Code**:
   - Discover how to test the impact of writing asynchronous code.
   - Learn best practices for testing async methods.

3. **Async Streaming, Cancellation, and Exception Handling**:
   - Explore async streaming and how to implement it.
   - Learn how to handle cancellation in asynchronous operations.
   - Understand how to deal with exceptions in async code.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will:
- Know the ins and outs of writing asynchronous code in ASP.NET Core.
- Be able to improve the scalability and performance of your APIs.
- Have a solid understanding of async/await and how to effectively use them in your projects.

## Prerequisites

Before taking this course, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of ASP.NET Core.
